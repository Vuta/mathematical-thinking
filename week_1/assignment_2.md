#### Q1. Simplify the following symbolic statements as much as you can, leaving your answer in the standard symbolic form. 

(In case you are not familiar with the notation, I’ll answer the first one for you.)

(a)  (π > 0) ∧ (π < 10)  [Answer:  0 < π < 10.]

(b)  (p <= 7) ∧ (p < 12)

(c)  (x > 5) ∧ (x < 7)

(d)  (x < 4) ∧ (x < 6)

(e)  (y < 4) ∧ (y² < 9)

(f)  (x ≥ 0) ∧ (x ≤ 0)

A:

(b) 7 ≤ p < 12

(c) 5 < x < 7

(d) x < 4

(e) -3 < y < 3

(f) x = 0

#### Q2. Express each of your simplified statements from question 1 in natural English.

A:

(a) π is greater than 0 and less than 10

(b) p is less than 12, and greater than or equal to 7

(c) x is less than 7 and greater than 5

(d) x is less than 4

(e) y is less than 3 and greater than -3

(f) x is equal to 0

#### Q3. What strategy would you adopt to show that the conjunction φ1 ∧ φ2 ∧...∧ φn is true?

A: We need to prove that ϕ1, ϕ2, ..., ϕn are all true.

#### Q4. What strategy would you adopt to show that the conjunction φ1 ∧ φ2 ∧...∧ φn is false?

A: We need to prove at least one of those ϕ is false.

#### Q5: Simplify the following symbolic statements as much as you can, leaving your answer in a standard symbolic form (assuming you are familiar with the notation):

(a) (π > 3) ∨ (π > 10)

(b) (x < 0) ∨ (x > 0)

(c) (x = 0) ∨ (x > 0)

(d) (x > 0) ∨ (x ≥ 0)

(e) (x > 3) ∨ (x² > 9)

A:

(a) π > 3

(b) x ≠ 0

(c) x ≥ 0

(d) x ≥ 0

(e) (x > 3) v (x < -3)

#### Q6. Express each of your simplified statements from question 5 in natural English.

A:

(a) π is greater than 3

(b) x is not equal to 0

(c) x is greater than or equal to 0

(d) x is greater than or equal to 0

(e) x is less than -3 or greater than 3

#### Q7. What strategy would you adopt to show that the disjunction ϕ1 v ϕ2 v ... v ϕn is true?

A: We need to prove at least one of those ϕ is true

#### Q8. What strategy would you adopt to show that the disjunction φ1 ∨ φ2 ∨... ∨ φn is false?

A: We need to prove all ϕ are false

#### Q9. Simplify the following symbolic statements as much as you can, leaving your answer in a standard symbolic form (assuming you are familiar with the notation):

(a) ¬(π > 3.2)

(b) ¬(x < 0)

(c) ¬(x² > 0)

(d) ¬(x = 1)

(e) ¬¬ψ

A:

(a) π ≤ 3.2

(b) x ≥ 0

(c) x = 0

(d) x ≠ 1

(e) ψ

#### Q10. Express each of your simplified statements from question 9 in natural English.

A:

(a) π is less than or equal to 3.2

(b) x is greater than or equal to 0

(c) x is equal to 0

(d) x is not equal to 0

(e) 

#### Q11. Let D be the statement "The dollar is strong", Y the statement "The Yuan is strong", and T the statement "New US–China trade agreement signed". Express the main content of each of the following (fictitious) newspaper headlines in logical notation. (Note that logical notation captures truth, but not the many nuances and inferences of natural language.) How would you justify and defend your answers?

(a) Dollar and Yuan both strong.

(b) Yuan weak despite new trade agreement, but Dollar remains strong.

(c) Dollar and Yuan can’t both be strong at same time.

(d) New trade agreement does not prevent fall in Dollar and Yuan.

(e) US–China trade agreement fails but both currencies remain strong.

A:

(a) D ^ Y

(b) ¬Y ^ T ^ D

(c) (D ^ ¬Y) v (¬D ^ Y)

(d) T ^ ¬D ^ ¬Y

(e) ¬T ^ D ^ Y
