# Assignment 1 (For lecture 1)

Q1. Find two unambiguous (but natural sounding) sentences equivalent to the sentence "The man saw the woman with a telescope", the first where the man has the telescope, the second where the woman has the telescope.

A: - The man used a telescope to see the woman.
        - The man saw the woman who has a telescope.

Q2. For each of the three ambiguous newspaper headlines I stated in the lecture, rewrite it in a way that avoids the amusing second meaning, while retaining the brevity of a typical headline:

(a) Sisters reunited after ten years in checkout line at Safeway.
(b) Large hole appears in High Street. City authorities are looking into it.
(c) Mayor says bus passengers should be belted.

Answer:

(a) Sisters reunited at Safeway's checkout line after ten years apart.
(b) City authorities are looking into a large hole that appears in High Street.
(c) Mayor says bus passengers should wear seat belt.

Q3. The following notice was posted on the wall of a hospital emergency room:

    No head injury is too trivial to ignore.
    
Reformulate to avoid the unintended second reading. (The context for this sentence is so strongthat many people have difficulty seeing there is an alternative meaning.)

A: All head injury is too important that can't be ignored.

Q4. You often see the following notice posted in elevators:

    In case of fire, do not use elevator.
    
This one always amuses me. Comment on the two meanings and reformulate to avoid the unintended second reading. (Again, given the context for this notice, the ambiguity is no problematic.)

A: 

Meaning 1: Do not use the elevator as there is a risk of fire.
Meaning 2: The elevator cannot be used if there is a fire.

Reformulate: Do not use the elevator if there is a fire

Q5. Official documents often contain one or more pages that are empty apart from one sentence at thebottom:

    This page intentionally left blank.
    
Does  the  sentence  make  a  true  statement?  What  is  the  purpose  of  making  such  a  statement? 
What reformulation of the sentence would avoid any logical problems about truth? 
(Once again, the context means that in practice everyone understands the intended meaning and there is no problem. 
But the formulation of a similar sentence in mathematics at the start of the twentieth century destroyed one prominent mathematicianâ€™s seminal work and led to a major revolution in an entire branch of mathematics.)

A: This is not a true statement because if it's true, the page is no longer blank.
Reformulate: The rest of this page intentionally left blank.

Q6. Find (and provide citations for) three examples of published sentences whose literal meaning is (clearly) not what the writer intended. [This is much easier than you might think. Ambiguity is very common.]

A:

1. This page intentionally left blank.
2. I'm not good at English :'(
3. 

Q7. Comment on the sentence "The temperature is hot today." You hear people say things like this all the time, and everyone understands what is meant. But using language in this sloppy way in mathematics would be disastrous.

A:

The temperature cannot be descirbed as hot or cold, but should be high or low instead.
Then the sentence should be "The temperate is high today" or "The weather is hot today".

Q8: How would you show that not every number of the form N = (p1 * p2 * p3 * . . . * pn) + 1 is prime, where p1, p2, p3, ..., pn, ...is the list of all prime numbers?

A: Let's say that n = 6, then N = (2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13) + 1 = 30031 = 59 * 509 => N is not a prime number.

So not that every number of the form N = (p1 * p2 * ... * pn) + 1 is a prime number, where p1, p2, ..., pn is the list of all prime numbers.
